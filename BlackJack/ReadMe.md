# Description
A simple, text based blackjack game. Made a blackjack game back around 2019, so decided to remake it to 1) introduce myself to github and 2) see 
what improvements I could make. I deleted the original git because I wanted to move these smaller, 1 file projects into a repository
to declutter my profile.

### Rules of Blackjack
- Most rules abridged from https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/
- Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
- It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
- Before the deal begins, each player places a bet.
- When all the players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face 
  up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes the second card face down.
- The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt 
  to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask 
  the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). 
  In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered.
- When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 
  or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. 
  If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. 
  The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.
- If a player's first two cards are of the same denomination, such as two jacks or two sixes, they may choose to treat them as two separate hands
  when their turn comes around. The amount of the original bet then goes on one of the cards, and an equal amount must be placed as a bet on the other card. 
  The player first plays the hand to their left by standing or hitting one or more times; only then is the hand to the right played. The two hands are thus 
  treated separately, and the dealer settles with each on its own merits. With a pair of aces, the player is given one card for each ace and may not draw 
  again. 
- Another option open to the player is doubling their bet. When the player's turn comes, they place a bet equal to the original bet, and the dealer gives 
  the player just one card, which is placed face down and is not turned up until the bets are settled at the end of the hand. With two fives, the player may 
  split a pair, double down, or just play the hand in the regular way. Note that the dealer does not have the option of splitting or doubling down.
