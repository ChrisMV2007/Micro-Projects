# Description
A program that uses beautiful soup and concurrent futures to scrape ebay and return best match fan products with (relatively) quick
speed. This project was originally going to be a part of the WCC hackathon, but it was never implemented due to time constraint. Without
the pressure of a hackathon deadline, I was able to construct an optimized text-based scraper (and finally use my beautiful soup / threading
knowledge to use).
